# puregym-apple-wallet

Easily add your PureGym QR code to Apple Wallet for quick gym access.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Open the PureGym app and display your QR code.
2. Take a screenshot of the QR code.
3. Open the **Photos** app on your iPhone and scan the QR code from the screenshot.
4. You'll receive a **link** — this is your **unique access code**.
5. Download a free app from the App Store to create Apple Wallet passes.  
   👉 I recommend **Pass4Wallet**.

## 📲 In the Pass4Wallet App

- Choose **Store Card** (default option).
- Paste your **unique access code** into the **Card Number** field.
- Add a name and customize it with logos or colors.
- Enable **"Select relevant location"** if you want the pass to appear automatically when you're near your PureGym.
- Optionally, add your **PIN code** in the **Back Side Notes** section.

## 🔄 Updating Your Pass
Codes are valid for limited time so you will need to update the code when it stops working. 

- Just take another screenshot, copy the QR code.
- Open the pass on Wallet and click three dots on the upper-right corner. Then click Pass Details.
- Find **"Edit in Pass4Wallet app"** link.
- Paste the copied (new) code into QR code field, then save and update the existing pass.

Enjoy! No need to open the PureGym app and wait for the QR code to load.  
Just scan your Wallet pass at entry and exit.
